		<p>This app was inspired by the real life Maersk app called Captain Peter. <a href="https://remotecontainermanagement.com/">Learn More about Captain Peter</a>. This application allows you to manage containers for different clients and monitor the condition of simulated cargo in real time. It was developed in a small team of three using Agile project management as a final project for the Agile Object Oriented Development class I took during my time studying in Denmark.

		<p>This database simulated the logistics chain for an Ikea store. Tables were created for everything from products to parts to part suppliers. General employee information was also simulated in the Ikeas store and warehouse database. This database was developed in a small team of four and was created using SQL as a final project for the Database systems class I took studying in Denmark.
